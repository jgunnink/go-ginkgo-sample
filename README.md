# Go with Ginkgo sample

This repository is designed to show how you can use ginkgo to do BDD style testing.

Note Ginkgo's philosophy is to not use .feature files and therefore the cucumber spec (in case that's what you're looking for), but is a
great way to provide human readable tests for anyone in the project, be they technical or not.

These are most useful as integration tests, rather than unit tests, as there's better way to do unit testing than what's been demoed here.
